Luau is a programming language that adds the ability of adding interactivity to your Roblox game, as in adding responses to specfic inputs , touching a part or pressing a button or key, and behaviour to your game enviroment; with the Roblox API.

This website helps you get started with Luau and furthers your understanding of what is possible withthin Roblox Studio.

# What is Luau?

[Luau](https://roblox.github.io/luau) ( pronounced "l-wow" ) is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed embeddable scripting language derived from Lua, we will go on what all of this means later. It is
used by Roblox game developers to write game code, as well as by Roblox engineers to implement large parts of the
user-facing application code as well as portions of the editor (Roblox Studio) as plugins.


It was created by the Roblox corp. and  is currently only runnable from the context of the Roblox engine, which exposes a large API surface documented on [Roblox developer portal](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference).

Luau is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, containing 2D and 3D graphics, plugins, and modules used all over the open-source community.

# A Hello world! example

Getting comfortable with Luau might be challenging so you may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine where and how to write/run Luau code in Roblox Studio to create a Hello world! example. (Hello world! is [the standard for introductory programming examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"Hello,_World!"_program).)

You can run code by using: 
- Command Bar and pressing Enter.

- LocalScript/Script (we will explain the difference later with the Client-Server model) and pressing ![PlaySolo](/resources/PlaySolo.png).

You have to write
```lua
print("Hello world!")
```
in the place of your choice.

If you have your Output windows open, you should `Hello world!` in there.
